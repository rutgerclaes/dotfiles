# dotfiles

This is a guide to setting up my personal development environment
on a Mac. It's meant get me up and running as fast as possible on a clean
install of macOS.

## Installation

*warning:* If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork
this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need.
don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your
own risk!

### Prerequisites
